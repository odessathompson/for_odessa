	<p>This year our research team had the amazing honor of being selected to participate in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our project was creating a biodegradable algae bioplastic from agar, then testing it in a series of simulated marine ecosystems. We recorded both its biodegradation rate as well as its effect on the water quality levels and organisms. ISEF was an incredible experience and we met students from Portugal to Texas to Sweden.<p>
