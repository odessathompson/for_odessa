	<p>Odessa Thompson is a student at Camas High School. She is in a research focused Math Science and Technology Magnet Program and is curious about anything STEM related. Odessa has a particular affinity of whales and hopes to study a form enviromental science or marine biology in the future. She also quite likes computer programming and design, which she pursues by taking AP Computer Science, making webistes for said class final, and helping lead her highschool chapter of Girls Who Code. I can't stand writing in third person any more, so please explore the rest of my website now.</p>

	<p>This year our research team had the amazing honor of being selected to participate in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our project was creating a biodegradable algae bioplastic from agar, then testing it in a series of simulated marine ecosystems. We recorded both its biodegradation rate as well as its effect on the water quality levels and organisms. ISEF was an incredible experience and we met students from Portugal to Texas to Sweden.<p>
